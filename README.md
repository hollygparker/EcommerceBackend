# Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment is to create API routes to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE data from a database, using Sequelize to build out said database. Additionally, the purpose is to use Postman to utilize these routes and post more data to the database.

# My Experience
I enjoyed creating the API routes for this app and practicing with Postman to utilize these routes. I especially liked the POST calls.
